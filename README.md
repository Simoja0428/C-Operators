# C-Relational-and-Arthimetic-Operators
In the last project we took an in depth look at basic data types in C++ programming. The following repository details how we can use Relational and Arithmetic operators to sort and manipulate data in our basic data types. This section is incredibly important, YOU WILL use all the information in this project in pretty much every project you do from here on out.

## Arthimetic Operators
Arthimetic operators are simply operations that we can perform on number based data types (Integers, Doubles, Floats,  etc.) The chances are you have previously worked with all of these major operations. The 5 major arthimetic operators used in Computer Science are comprised of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus. 

### Addition


### Subtraction


### Multiplication


### Division


### Modulus


## Relational Operators
