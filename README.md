# C-Basic-Operators
In the last project we took an in depth look at basic data types in C++ programming. The following repository details how we can use Relational, Logical and Arithmetic operators to sort and manipulate data in our basic data types. This section is incredibly important, YOU WILL use all the information in this project in pretty much every project you do from here on out.

## Arthimetic Operators
Arthimetic operators are simply operations that we can perform on number based data types (Integers, Doubles, Floats,  etc.) The chances are you have previously worked with all of these major operations. The 5 major arthimetic operators used in Computer Science are comprised of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus. 

### Addition
The addition operator is used when we want to add the values of two or more numbers together. When adding numbers together, we will want to make sure that we have this summed value stored in a seperate variable for later usage. Further, it is important to be concious of the types of all variables used in the operation. Remember, integers do not account for decimal values and forgetting this could lead to bugs in your future programs. Below are some examples of using the addition operator in C++.

```c++
int sum = 1 + 2;
double dSum = 1.5 + 3.2;
int wSum = 1.5 + 3;
```

The values of the variables in the code above are as follows:

```
Value of sum: 3
Value of dSum: 4.7
Value of wSum: 4
```

### Multiplication


### Division


### Modulus


## Relational Operators
